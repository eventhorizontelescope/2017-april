er1v2
=====
Corrected ALMA DPFU factor: From 0.1 to 10.0
Corrected APEX Tsys (using the 4-8 GHz part of the IF instead of 8-12 GHz)

er1v3
=====
Scaled down PV DPFU by 89% following https://eventhorizontelescope.teamwork.com/#notebooks/95656

er2
===
Scaled down APEX DPFU by (1+0.01)**2 following https://eventhorizontelescope.teamwork.com/#notebooks/95656
Scaled down PV DPFU by the correct (1+0.89)**2 now, following https://eventhorizontelescope.teamwork.com/#notebooks/95656
Added comments about estimated uncertainties in the ANTAB tables
Using time-dependent DPFU for JCMT following https://eventhorizontelescope.teamwork.com/#files/1917093
Updated APEX DPFU: 0.0267 -> 0.02478, 0.02521 (before down-scaling)
Added gain curve for APEX
Updated PV DPFU (using direct fit to data now): 0.172 -> 0.126, 0.122 (before down-scaling)
Updated PV gaincurve (using direct fit to data now): 0.36029, 0.026008, -0.00026431 -> 0.75921, 0.010647, -0.0001177
Fixed SMA INDEX: Previously rcp and lcp for lo and hi were labeled in the wrong order

er3-1
=====
added SPT DPFU and Tsys
Updated ALMA SEFDs - moved from ad-hoc values to correct frequency dependent solutions from Rev2 Polconvert executed in Rev3 correlation
ALMA ANTAB files pulled from the archive on 10:00UTC, 25 February 2018. Hi band ALMA ANTAB tables may not be complete yet.
Updated JCMT sideband ratio (2.25 instead of 2) following https://eventhorizontelescope.teamwork.com/#notebooks/90519
Resolved LMT RCP/LCP discrepencies
Gain curve fits of 1 - A * (el-el_max)**2 used now. These are expanded into a0,a1,a2 polynomials. The new fits are better for error propagation.
